A dime a dozen
Bite the bullet
Beat around the bush
A blessing in disguise
The ball is in your court
Hit the nail on the head
Barking up the wrong tree
Cry over spilled milk
Kick the bucket
Hit the sack
Birds of a feather flock together
Break the ice
Spill the beans
Achilles' heel
Spare the rod and spoil the child
Out of the blue
The early bird catches the worm
"Bite the bullet"
Burning the midnight oil
At the drop of a hat
Burn the midnight oil
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree
Let the cat out of the bag
A piece of cake
Under the weather
Bury the hatchet
hit the nail on the head
A penny for your thoughts
Break a leg
